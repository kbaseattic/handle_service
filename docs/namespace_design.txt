1. Use auto-deploy to override the Makefile variable.
2. In the makefile use tpage to write a Constants.pm file
3. In the makefile, deploy the Constants.pm file
4. In the Impl.pm file, use Constants.pm

1. the name space string is provided in the auto-deploy.cfg file to the auto-deploy program
2. the auto-deploy program over-rides a make variable in the make file
3. the make file uses the make variable to construct tpage args
4. tpage uses a template and the tpage args to construct a Constants.pm file
	the template goes in the service directory, it's needed by the service
5. the Constants.pm file gets deployed as part of the deploy-service target
6. the service Impl uses the Constants.pm module to obtain the name space string
	the use statement hard codes the package structure
	the package structure will depend on $(SERVICE_NAME) and that could
	change, SO, don't use make variables in the package namespace.
	
deploy-libs does the rsync of the lib directory to $TARGET
deploy-client depends on deploy-libs
deploy-libs depends on build libs
deploy-service does not depend on deploy-libs
	therefore the call to tpage needs to be here
	the default target doesn't work becuase auto-deploy calls deploy-
	client or deploy-service or both.
